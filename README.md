# AppHelpSeeker
This project is the back-end side of a web application that allows people in need of help to connect with volunteers that will help them.

This project was carried out as part of the SOA course. We explored the evolution of architectures by progressively developing the project through different approaches: starting with SOAP, then adopting REST, and finally transitioning to a microservices architecture. At the end of this process, we chose to finalize the project using microservices, providing a more flexible and scalable solution.
