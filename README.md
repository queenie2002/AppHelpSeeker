# SOAP_Tuto

We developped a few services to get more familiar with the SOAP architecture.
LoginProject and ExecuteQuery are SOAP services and ClientWS is a Client service that calls for them.

ExecuteQuery allows us to connect to the database and to execute either a query or an update.
LoginProject is a service that returns true if the username and password we give him are respectively "user" and "pwd".
